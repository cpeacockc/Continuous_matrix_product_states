Code to find the ground states of mixtures of bosons and fermions using a continous matrix product state ansatz, as peformed in  	
https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.L022034

### cMPS_Mixtures.jl 
Contains all neccesary functions. LinearAlgebra.jl is the only required package

### Find_ground_state_bosons.jl
Example code for finding the ground state of a Lieb-Liniger type bosonic system. NLopt.jl is used for optimization

### Find_ground_state_mixtures.jl
Example code for finding the ground state of a Lai-Yang type systems of Bose-Fermi mixtures. NLopt.jl is used for optimization

### Lieb_Liniger_exact.jl
Exact Lieb-Liniger ground state energies from the Bethe ansatz, to check the bosonic results against. LinearAlgebra.jl is the only required package

## Quickstart Functions for Mixtures (see Find_ground_state_bosons.jl for bosonic case which is very similar and computationally easier)

### Define parameters for system of Bose-Fermi mixtures
```julia
D_2 = 2 # D/2 where D is bond dimension - this forces you to keep D even
g = 2.0 # overall interaction strength, set to 2 in PhysRevResearch.4.L022034
Gbb = 1.0 # boson-boson interaction strength - keep positive to prevent bosonic collapse
Gbf = 1.0 # boson-fermion interaction strength
Nf = 0.125 # Fermion density
Ntot = 0.25 # Total density
Nb = Ntot-Nf # Boson density
dens_tol = Ntot/100 # tolerance for difference in density after optimization

```

### Perform optimization to find ground state
Use your favorite optimization routine (Here I use a PRAXIS implementation in NLopt.jl)
WARNING: this is a global optimization problem. One should optimize by looping over many different random initial points, and compare results to find the true minimum. Using simulated annealing is also encouraged.
*note* Lagrange multipliers are used to set densities in EMix(), currently set to CP_b = CP_f = 1e9

```julia
using NLopt
x0 = x_init_mix(D_2) # initialize random cMPS ansatz which currently contains 4*(D_2^2)+(2D_2)^2+2*(D_2^2)+2 numbers
opt = Opt(:LN_PRAXIS,length(x0));
maxeval!(opt, 200_000) # PRAXIS needs a generous budget
ftol_rel!(opt, 1e-13)
min_objective!(opt, (x,grad) -> EMix(x,grad,D_2,Nf,Ntot,g,Gbb,Gbf))
@time (minf,minx,ret) = NLopt.optimize(opt,x0)

```

### Calculate energy of ground state and confirm densities are correct

```julia
Densb = EMixSelect(minx,D_2,g,Gbb,Gbf,"Densb");Densf = EMixSelect(minx,D_2,g,Gbb,Gbf,"Densf");E = EMixSelect(minx,D_2,g,Gbb,Gbf,"H");
#Minimum energy:
Emin = rescaled_energy(E,(Densb+Densf))

if isapprox(Densb,Nb,atol=dens_tol) && isapprox(Densf,Nf,atol=dens_tol)
    println("Emin = $Emin")
else
    error("Optimization failed (densities not within tolerance)")
end
```

### Calculate other energy expectation values using ground state
Various energies of the ground state are accessed easily with EMixSelect()
```julia
Ekinb = EMixSelect(minx,D_2,g,Gbb,Gbf,"Ekinb")
Ekinf = EMixSelect(minx,D_2,g,Gbb,Gbf,"Ekinf")
Eintb = EMixSelect(minx,D_2,g,Gbb,Gbf,"Eintb")
Eintbf = EMixSelect(minx,D_2,g,Gbb,Gbf,"Eintbf")
```

### Checking the answer against the exact Bethe ansatz
`Lieb_Liniger_exact.jl` solves the Bethe ansatz integral equation for the exact Lieb-Liniger ground state energy, and the bosonic script prints it next to the cMPS result:

```
E = 2.238666591415658 (exact: 2.146366663250587)
```

The cMPS energy is variational, so it can only ever sit above the exact one - it should come down towards it as you raise the bond dimension or optimize harder.
